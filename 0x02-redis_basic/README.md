Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store. It can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis supports a wide range of data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. It also provides several advanced features such as transactions, pub/sub messaging, and Lua scripting.

Redis is often used as a cache because it can store data in memory and provides fast read and write access. Redis is also designed to be highly available and scalable, which makes it a popular choice for building distributed systems.

To use Redis, you need to install and run a Redis server. You can then connect to the Redis server from your application using a Redis client library. Redis client libraries are available for many programming languages, including Python, Java, and Ruby.
